*23/11/2018 - Remzi, Beatrice*

=== Errata Corrige
* The _Kalai–Smorodinsky solution_ takes the point whose utility ratio is equal to the ideal point's utility ratio
** i.e. it takes the intersection of the Pareto surface and the line connecting the ideal point and the disagreement point (that for us is 0)
** x~2~ / x~1~ = u~2~ / u~1~ -> x~2~ = u~2~ / u~1~ * x~1~
** but we are searching for the most equal distribution of losses 
* The _equal loss solution_ [9] takes the point in which the agents suffer equal losses from their utility levels at the ideal point
** u~2~ - x~2~ = u~1~ - x~1~ -> x~2~ = (u~2~ - u~1~) + x~1~ 
** *Problems*: it doesn't satisfy Pareto Optimality and Individual Rationality
* *Solution*: The _lexicographic equal-loss solution_ [10]

=== Desiderata
* ε(x~1~ ... x~n~) ∈ [0,1]  inequality function
** x ∈ R^n^~+~
** ε : R^n^~+~ -> [0,1]
* F(u) = {x ∈ PE(u) | ε( λ(x,y) )>=ε( λ(y,n) )  ∀ y ∈ A}

=== Questions
* What's ε?
** It might be the Standard deviation, Gini or others (see [11])
* Recall the question: _Suppose to deduce the alternatives's utility from the ranking (as in Borda) and to select a winner in the context of cardinal utility, to which voting rule it corresponds within the ordinal world?_ 
** It might depend on ε

=== Readings
* Take a look at: 
** [8] for comparisons of utility 
** *Volume 2 chapter 20* of [7] for utility functions
** [11] for an overview over the metrics used to measure inequality
