== Meeting 

*24/09/2019 - Remzi, Olivier, Beatrice*

=== Agenda
* Discussed about the example on page 2: trade-off between size of the q interval and the size of the ignored people. Decided to parametrize the example and explain both cases.
* Went through the TODOs 
* Side notes:
** Ipek mentioned some literature on bankruptcy for equal loss principle
** Axioms valid for equal loss solution surely help to characterize our cardinal compromise definition

=== Next steps
. Write the abstract and fix the example on pag 2
. Give references to literature and examples of spreading indices
. Check the proof and be sure that proposition 1 holds before Istanbul meeting
